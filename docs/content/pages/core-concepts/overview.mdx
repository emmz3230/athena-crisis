# Core Concepts – Overview

This section dives into the core concepts of the codebase to give you a high-level overview of how Athena Crisis works. This overview is for you if you are interested in the data structures and algorithms used in Athena Crisis. The technical walkthroughs primarily cover these three top-level folders in the repository:

- [`athena`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/athena) → Data structures and algorithms for manipulating _map_ state (_client/server_).
- [`apollo`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/apollo) → Data structures and algorithms for manipulating _game_ state (_client/server_).
- [`hera`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/hera) → Game engine and rendering (_client_).
- [`dionysus`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/hera) → AI implementation (_client/server_).

There are many tests covering almost all game related logic, with most end-to-end screenshot tests in the [`tests`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/tests) top-level folder. They are worth checking out when studying the codebase.
